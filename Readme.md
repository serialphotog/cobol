Various COBOL programs I've written for learning purposes.

**NOTE:** I've used GNU Cobol as the compiler for this. All of these programs use the ```>>>SOURCE FORMAT IS FREE``` directive and change the comment format to ```*>``` to coply with this compiler.
You can build these programs using:
```
cobc -x PROGRAM.cbl
```

# Contents

* hello.cbl - A simple hello world implemenation
* input.cbl - A simple user input example
